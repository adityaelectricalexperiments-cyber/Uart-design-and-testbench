# Uart-design-and-testbench
This project is made in edaplayground.com, I made this design using verilog hdl in FSM. Uart(universal asynchronous receiver transmitter).
->It is asynchronous communication protocol.
->It uses 2 line communication. So data will transmitted serially.
->One for transmission and one for receiver.
->uart communication speed between both device is configurable.
->Both devices should be configured with the same transmission speed(Baud rate).
->It has start bit and stop bit.
